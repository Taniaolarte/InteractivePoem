		<div>You found it hard to sleep.</div>
		<div>I stood by your bed last night,</div>
		<div>I whined to you so softly</div>
		<div>I could see that you were crying</div>
		<div></div>
		<div>As you brushed away a tear...</div>
		<div>“I’m well, I’m fine, I’m here."
</div>
		<div>“It’s me, I haven’t left you-
</div>
		<div>the pain of recalling memories of an empty life (playlist)</div>
		<div>START</div>
		<div>Interactive story from a Reddit poem from an unknown author
Please turn the sound on
</div>
		<div>I was close to you at breakfast,
</div>
		<div>Your hands reached down to me.
</div>
		<div>You were thinking of the many times
</div>
		<div>I longed to take the parcels,
</div>
		<div>I was with you at the shops today
</div>
		<div>I watched you pour the tea
</div>
		<div>I wished I could do more
</div>
		<div>You arms were getting sore.
</div>
		<div>I was with you at my grave today
You tend it with such care.</div>
		<div>I want to reassure you that I am not lying there.
I walked with you towards the house
</div>
		<div>As you fumbled for your keys.
I gently put my paw on you,
I smiled and said, “It’s me."
</div>
		<div>The day is over now...
</div>
		<div>You looked so very tired and sank into a chair
</div>
		<div>I was very close to you.
</div>
		<div>It’s possible for me to be so near you every day.</div>
		<div>and when the time is right for you to cross the brief divide,
</div>
		<div>I smiled and watch you yawning
</div>
		<div>That I was standing there.
</div>
		<div>Be patient, live your journey out...
</div>
		<div>I’ll rush across to greet you
And we’ll stand side by side.
</div>
		<div>And say, “Goodnight, God Bless,
I will see you in the morning"
</div>
		<div>I tried so hard to let you know
</div>
		<div>Then come home to be with me...
</div>
		<div>I have so many things to show you,
there is so much for you to see
</div>
		<div>I think you knew...</div>
		<div>To say to you with certainty, “I never went away"</div>
		<div>You sat there very quietly,then smiled,</div>
		<div>In the stillness of that evening
</div>
